         Introduction 

The abstract game of Qwirkle consists of 108 wooden blocks with 
six different shapes in six different colors. 
There is no board, players simply use an available flat surface. 
Players begin the game with six blocks. The start player places blocks of a single 
matching attribute (color or shape but not both) on the table. Thereafter, 
a player adds blocks adjacent to at least one previously played block. 
The blocks must all be played in a line and match, without duplicates, 
either the color or shape of the previous block.
 
To place a single tile use the following syntax : 
         place <tile> at <grid location>  
Note : tile name and grid location must be in Uppercase

To place multiple tiles use the following syntax : 
         place <tile> <tile> <tile> ... at <grid location> <grid location> <grid location>... 
Note : The tile location must map with the grid location & maximum 6 tiles can be placed at once

         Adding Tiles 

All tiles must connect to the grid and form a line of two or more tiles.
A line is either all one shape or all one color.
Tiles that are added to a line must share the same attribute as the tiles that are already in that line.
You may play multiple tiles on your turn as long as all tiles played are
the same color or the same shape and are placed in the same line.
You cannot play two tiles that are exactly the same.
At least one of the tiles you play must touch (side to side) a tile
that has already been played and match the tile in color or shape.
Any tiles that touch each other are part of a line.
Lines are either all one shape or all one color, without any duplicates.

         Replace tile 

To replace a tile follow the command:
         replace <tile>  

         Saving a file

To Save a file follow the command:
         save <filename>  
Note: You dont have to put any extensions
         Scoring 

When you create a line, you score one point for each tile in that
line (including the tiles that already existed on the grid).
 When a tile is part of two different lines, it will score 2 points.
You score 6 bonus points whenever you complete a line of 6 tiles, which is called a Qwirkle.
